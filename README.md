## Time Capsule
Time Capsule is a simple Streamlit web app that lets you hide (decode) secret messages using a custom alphabet-based number cipher.

### How It Works
You enter a secret message.
You enter a key (a date like DDMMYYYY).
The app decodes your message using the key, where each letter is shifted backward based on the key digits.
Spaces are kept as-is.

### Built With
Python 
Streamlit 

Run It
``streamlit run your_script.py``
